I don´t know much of HTML or CSS, but I was able to do this website thanks to the tutorial: 
Build your personal or project website with GitHub Pages. by Sarah Schöttler from the Centre of Data and Society of The university of Edinburgh

I have used one of the themes designed by: HTML5 UP . Thanks.
